<h1>CORS tutorial</h1>
<p>CORS can be confusing for beginners. Here's an interactive introduction.</p>

<h2>A long time ago...</h2>

<p>
  When JavaScript was first created, any site could create a script to make requests to another site.
  This means that it could easily be abused to make calls to do things like steal information from a user.
</p>

<p>
  So to fix this, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a>
  was created. This means the browser protects the user by preventing a malicious site from gathering your data from
  another site.
</p>

<h2>Example 1: View all my private repos</h2>

<p>
  This is the call the GitHub UI makes to list repositories. Click the "GET all repos" to try it out.
</p>

<script>
  async function getAllRepos() {
    const url = "https://github.com/jakecoffman?tab=repositories"
    try {
      await fetch(url, {
        method: 'delete'
      })
    } catch (e) {
      alert(e)
    }
  }
</script>

<button onclick="getAllRepos()">GET all repos</button>

<p>
  The alert I get says "TypeError: Failed to fetch", but if you open the console it also says:
</p>

<code>Access to fetch at 'https://github.com/jakecoffman?tab=repositories' from origin 'https://www.jakecoffman.com'
  has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs,
  set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.</code>

<p>
  So even though I am currently logged in to GitHub when I click this, my browser is preventing the JavaScript from
  grabbing my private repos and doing nefarious things with it.
</p>

<p>
  Also GitHub is probably blocking the request too since the Origin header is set by the browser. That prevents you from
  forcing me to delete my own repos with a script.
</p>

<h2>Example 2: Access-Control-Allow-Origin</h2>

<p>
  httpbin is a site that lets you test out HTTP calls, so they set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header
  to your <code>Origin</code> so the call will work. Try it out:
</p>

<script>
  async function post() {
    const result = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', {
      method: 'post',
      body: JSON.stringify({hello: 'world!'})}
    )
    alert(await result.text())
  }
</script>

<button onclick="post()">POST to httpbin.org</button>

<p>
  If you open the Network tab in Developer Tools you can look at the header yourself.
</p>

<h2>That's It!</h2>

<p>
  That is the basis of all CORS headers. The browser is trying to protect you from evil-doers and their JavaScript that
  is running on your machine!
</p>
